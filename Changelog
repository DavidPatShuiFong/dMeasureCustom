Changelog

0.2.0 - 20th May 2020
=====================

Changes to allow storage of patient lists in dMeasure

* initialize_data_table to create table CustomPatientLists in
   dMeasure's SQLite configuration database
* read_configuration_db reads CustomPatientLists and stores
   the list/dataframe in self$patientList
  columns are id (numeric), name (character) and patientList (blob)
  note that $patientList cannot be manipulated by dplyr due
  to the presence of the blob.
* write_patientList - adds patient list stored in CSV
* remove_patientList - removes by name
